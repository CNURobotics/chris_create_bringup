chris_create_bringup
====================

This package handles the bring up of the CNU specific configuration of iRobot Create, LIDAR, and camera sensors.

The main `chris_create_bringup.launch` file starts the system with the default configuration used in the lab with one Hokuyo URG-04LX lidar and two web cameras.
A number of additional launch files are included.

This repository includes an open-source mesh for the lidar, and parameters files used by the cameras.
